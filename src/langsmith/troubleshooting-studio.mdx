## Safari Connection Issues

Safari blocks plain-HTTP traffic on localhost. When running Studio with `langgraph dev`, you may see "Failed to load assistants" errors.

### Solution 1: Use Cloudflare Tunnel

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">
    ```shell
    pip install -U langgraph-cli>=0.2.6
    langgraph dev --tunnel
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JS">
    ```shell
    # Requires @langchain/langgraph-cli>=0.0.26
    npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev --tunnel
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

The command outputs a URL in this format:

```shell
https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=https://hamilton-praise-heart-costumes.trycloudflare.com
```

Use this URL in Safari to load Studio. Here, the `baseUrl` parameter specifies your agent server endpoint.

### Solution 2: Use Chromium browser

Chrome and other Chromium browsers allow HTTP on localhost. Use `langgraph dev` without additional configuration.

## Chrome connection issues

Starting with Chrome version 142, you may experience "Failed to initialize Studio" errors with "TypeError: Failed to fetch" when trying to connect [LangSmith Studio](/langsmith/studio) to your local development server via [`langgraph dev`](/langsmith/cli). This occurs even when the API server at `http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs` loads successfully.

**Root Cause:** Chrome 142 fully enforces the Private Network Access (PNA) specification with no fallback, which blocks HTTPS sites (like `https://smith.langchain.com`) from accessing HTTP localhost servers by default.

### Symptoms

- Running `langgraph dev` starts the server successfully.
- Navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs` shows the API documentation correctly.
- LangSmith Studio at `https://smith.langchain.com` shows: "Failed to initialize Studio - Please verify if the API server is running or accessible from the browser. TypeError: Failed to fetch".
- Browser console shows errors like: `Permission was denied for this request to access the 'unknown' address space`.

### Solution: Allow local network access in Chrome

1. Open LangSmith Studio at `https://smith.langchain.com` in Chrome.
2. Click the **lock icon** (or site information icon) to the left of the address bar.
3. Look for the **"Local network access"** option in the dropdown.
4. Change the setting from **"Ask (default)"** or **"Block"** to **"Allow"**.
5. Reload the page.

Studio should now connect to your local development server successfully.

### Additional troubleshooting

**Check for browser extension conflicts**

Browser extensions (especially Ollama Chrome extension or AI model extensions) can interfere with localhost connections:

1. Disable all browser extensions temporarily.
2. Restart Chrome.
3. Try connecting to Studio again.
4. If it works, re-enable extensions one by one to identify the culprit.

**Verify dependencies are up to date**

```shell
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
```

**Clear browser cache and site data**

1. In Chrome, go to **Settings** > **Privacy and Security** > **Site Settings**.
2. Find `https://smith.langchain.com` in the list.
3. Click **Clear data**.
4. Restart Chrome and try again.

## Brave Connection Issues

Brave blocks plain-HTTP traffic on localhost when Brave Shields are enabled. When running Studio with `langgraph dev`, you may see "Failed to load assistants" errors.

### Solution 1: Disable Brave Shields

Disable Brave Shields for LangSmith using the Brave icon in the URL bar.

### Solution 2: Use Cloudflare Tunnel

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">
    ```shell
    pip install -U langgraph-cli>=0.2.6
    langgraph dev --tunnel
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JS">
    ```shell
    # Requires @langchain/langgraph-cli>=0.0.26
    npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev --tunnel
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

The command outputs a URL in this format:

```shell
https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=https://hamilton-praise-heart-costumes.trycloudflare.com
```

Use this URL in Brave to load Studio. Here, the `baseUrl` parameter specifies your agent server endpoint.

## Graph Edge Issues

Undefined conditional edges may show unexpected connections in your graph. This is
because without proper definition, Studio assumes the conditional edge could access all other nodes. To address this, explicitly define the routing paths using one of these methods:

### Solution 1: Path map

Define a mapping between router outputs and target nodes:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    graph.add_conditional_edges("node_a", routing_function, {True: "node_b", False: "node_c"})
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Javascript">
    ```ts
    graph.addConditionalEdges("node_a", routingFunction, { true: "node_b", false: "node_c" });
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<a id="python"></a>
### Solution 2: Router type definition

Specify possible routing destinations using Python's `Literal` type:

```python
def routing_function(state: GraphState) -> Literal["node_b","node_c"]:
    if state['some_condition'] == True:
        return "node_b"
    else:
        return "node_c"
```

## Command Selection Issues

### `langgraph up` fails but `langgraph dev` works

This is usually caused by Docker-related issues. Here's how to diagnose:

**Check if Docker is running:**
```bash
docker ps
```

If this fails, Docker isn't running or isn't installed.

**Check for port conflicts:**
```bash
# Check if required ports are available
lsof -i :8123  # API server
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL
lsof -i :6379  # Redis
```

**Solutions:**
- Install and start Docker Desktop
- Stop services using conflicting ports
- Use `langgraph dev` for development (doesn't require Docker)
- Use `--port` flag to change the API server port: `langgraph up --port 8124`

**Check available resources:**

`langgraph up` requires more RAM and disk space than `langgraph dev` because it runs PostgreSQL and Redis containers.

**Solutions:**
- Free up system resources
- Use `langgraph dev` for lightweight testing

### `langgraph dev` works but production deployment fails

This can happen because `langgraph dev` is more permissive than production environments.

**Common causes:**
- Dependencies not properly specified in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`
- Code relies on development-only features
- Environment variables not configured for production
- State persistence assumptions (dev uses in-memory storage)

**Solutions:**
- Test with `langgraph up` before deploying to catch issues early
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in your package configuration
- Review [Application Structure](/langsmith/application-structure) guide
- See the [Local development & testing guide](/langsmith/local-dev-testing) for more details

### Dependencies install with pip but not with uv (or vice versa)

Starting from LangGraph CLI v0.3, `uv` is the default installer. Some dependency configurations work with one but not the other.

**When uv fails:**

Add this to your `langgraph.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "pip_installer": "pip"
}
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
langgraph up --recreate
```

**When pip fails but uv would work:**

Add this to your `langgraph.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "pip_installer": "uv"
}
```

**Common uv issues:**
- Complex `pyproject.toml` configurations with advanced features
- Corporate package indexes that aren't configured for uv
- Custom build systems expecting pip-specific behavior

See the [Dependency installer guide](/langsmith/local-dev-testing#dependency-installer) for more details.

### Graph works in dev but state doesn't persist between restarts

This is expected behavior. `langgraph dev` uses in-memory storage that is cleared on restart.

**Solution:**

Use `langgraph up` for testing with persistent storage:
```bash
langgraph up
```

With `langgraph up`, state is stored in PostgreSQL and persists across restarts.

### Production deployment works but `langgraph up` fails locally

This can happen due to local environment differences.

**Common causes:**
- Docker not configured properly locally
- Port conflicts with other local services
- Network issues (VPN, firewall, proxy)
- Resource constraints on local machine
- Different installer configuration (uv vs pip)

**Solutions:**
- Use `langgraph dev` for local testing
- Check Docker installation and configuration
- Review the [Local vs production differences](/langsmith/local-dev-testing#local-vs-production-troubleshooting) section
- Ensure your `pip_installer` setting matches production

### Docker build fails with "failed to solve" errors

This usually indicates issues with your Dockerfile or dependency installation.

**Check your dependency configuration:**
```bash
# Verify your langgraph.json points to the right location
cat langgraph.json
```

**Try rebuilding from scratch:**
```bash
langgraph up --recreate --no-pull
```

**Switch installer if needed:**

Add to `langgraph.json`:
```json
{
  "pip_installer": "pip"
}
```

**Check for missing files:**

Ensure your package configuration files exist:
- `pyproject.toml` or
- `setup.py` or
- `requirements.txt`

## Experiment troubleshooting in Studio

### **Run experiment** button is disabled

Check the following:

- **Deployed application**: If your application is deployed on LangSmith, you may need to create a new revision to enable this feature.
- **Local development server**: If you are running your application locally, make sure you have upgraded to the latest version of the `langgraph-cli` (`pip install -U langgraph-cli`). Additionally, ensure you have tracing enabled by setting the `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` in your project's `.env` file.

### Evaluator results are missing

When you run an experiment, any attached evaluators are scheduled for execution in a queue. If you don't see results immediately, it likely means they are still pending.
